Documentation for MShePy is found [here](https://docs.mikepoweredbydhi.com/engine_libraries/MShe/MShePyApi/). MShePy is designed specifically for situations where the users wants to modify the current state based on the current state of other variables in the model, for example, calculating the current evaportranspiration based on the modeled soil moisture at a timestep. This can be done with MShePy in two ways, \n",

For this reason, you can only run one of the examples in this notebook at a time. Before running the next example, you may need to restart your kernal.***\n"
